Spoilers for *The Fault in Our Stars*, I guess.

*The Fault in Our Stars* describes the phenomenon of the Last Good Day and this has been echoing in my head ever since.  In the novel, the Last Good Day is the final time a person who is slowly deteriorating has a peaceful and pleasant moment with those around them.

> There's no way of knowing that your last good day is Your Last Good Day. At the time, it is just another good day.

The story presents this in the context of Augustus' worsening condition and eventual death.

So far, I've been lucky enough to have never needed to face a slow health decline in myself or those close to me, but the concept of the Last Good Day has sat quietly in the back of my mind since reading it.  Whenever I have some kind of impending loss, on any scale, my thoughts tend to orbit around it.
