Over the past 2 years I have slowly been building tools for myself, starting with the now-defunct COVID-19 Tracker.  I have learnt a lot doing this (most of what I know actually), but the most rewarding part of the experience is the using.  Building things is immensely frustrating and satisfying, but using it for months and years afterwards is a lovely experience.
